This seems to work correctly. Got the program automation in for DB update. Be nice if the DB updated after software upgrade without having to launch the console once.
(Yes, it's dumb.. Yes, Deploy and Inventory updates itself, i know. It was more an exercise for me to see if I could get it written.)
